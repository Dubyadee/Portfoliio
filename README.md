Final Portfolio for DGST 302

This repository is a compilation space for my 4 selected and improved projects for DGST 302.

NOVEL:

This is a project I was quite pleased with, but I wanted to make some aesthetic changes for thematic reinforcement. The first change is that I multiplied the string length for the "Reality Surf" text by 20. I noticed that is was making as many clear appearances as I wanted, so I increased the sample size to increase the text presence. I then removed the page numbering and footers, as I wanted the "Epochs" to be the sole indicators of place/interval. I also think this brings more attention to the sheer scale of time, if you are unable to plot your relative space to beginning or end. The final change was the page color. I changed it to a more beige/brown gradient background to evoke a feeling of age. The idea of stories and narratives being ancient relics the transcend their own manifestation is something that I wanted to make more apparent. In general I made changes to this project for the sake of character.

SCREENSAVER:

This is another one where I was rather pleased with the original. The primary changes are in randomization. I randomized the speeds of the blocks with each running of the sketch, making it more varied and hectic. I also made it so that the sketch initializes with color rather than everything beginning as plain white. On the more technical end I made the dimensions of the blocks scale and vary according to the screen size, rather than being a fized 100 by 100. The overlapping blocks adds more variety to the 3D appearance. In general I just wanted this one to be more varied and interesting.

CLOCK:

This one was more akin to a flat out improvement from dissatisfaction. I changed the "progress bars" to fill  in more space and scale to screen dimensions. This change also allowed me to position the numerical display, to express how various "sizes" of time measurements fit inside each other. The addition of the infinity symbol on the hours bar, using the milliseconds color, expresses the eternal sycle of measured time. I'm pleased with the aesthetic changes for this project, yet I still would like to synchronize the milliseconds properly with the seconds.

TWITTER BOT:

This is the least impactful change, but I think an overall improvement. I simply added around 30% more variables for permutation, expanding emojis and vocabulary. I also added mutiple copies of root phrases to change the probability of which ones appear, and then added some additional rare phrases to act as "easter eggs". I think that this  adds to the aesthetic theme of the profile and breaks up some of the monotony. There isn't a whole lot to talk about here, it is just a simple expansion for the most part.
